In React Native, a common yet subtle issue arises when using the `FlatList` component with complex data structures or frequent updates.  If not handled correctly, this can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering, performance issues, and even crashes.  The problem often stems from improper use of the `keyExtractor` prop or inefficient data management within the `renderItem` function.
