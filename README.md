# React Native FlatList Performance and Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using `FlatList` in React Native: performance degradation and unexpected rendering behavior due to inefficient data handling.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected and optimized version.

**Problem:** The initial implementation uses a flawed `keyExtractor` and inefficient data processing within `renderItem`, leading to performance bottlenecks and incorrect rendering, especially with large datasets or frequent updates.

**Solution:** The solution involves implementing a robust `keyExtractor` using a unique identifier from the data and optimizing data processing within `renderItem` to minimize unnecessary computations.
